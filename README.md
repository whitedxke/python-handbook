# Python-handbook.

Python Handbook by Yandex-Education.

## Description.

Python-handbook is my personal repository, where study and reinforce the material from the «Python Handbook» by Yandex Education. Systematically explore the core concepts of the language, as well as various programming approaches implemented in Python.

After each chapter, complete practical exercises and save the source code in this repository. By the end of the course, also plan to work with Python’s applied libraries.
